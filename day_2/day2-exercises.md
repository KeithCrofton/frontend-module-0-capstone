1. ordered lists <ol> have numbered items, these are good for when you have to do something in order.<li> holds list items. Unordered lists <ul> are listed items that do not have to be in any particular order, instead of numbers they use bullet points.<li> holds list items. Definition lists <dl> are lists with pairs of terms and Definitions. <dt> holds the term and <dd> holds the definition.
2. <a href="http://www.website.com">bodytext</a>
3. Add target="_blank" at the end of the opening tag. If my answer to question two was changed to open in a new window it would look like this <a href="http://www.website.com" target="blank">bodytext</a> (opens in new window) Its good form to let the user know another window is opening.
4. To link to a specific part of the same page is similar to linking to a different page. The difference is the href doesnt have a url, it has a "#linklocation" that connects via an id attribute located farther down the page that looks like <h1 id="linklocation">
